### Title

Systematic characterization of 21 post-translational modification using synthetic peptides

### Description

The data presented in this study in the - context of the ProteoemTools project - is based on the synthesis of about 5000 synthetic peptides carrying 21 different post-translational modifications to systematically characterize their chromatographic and mass spectrometric properties using multimodal LC-MS/MS.

### Sample Processing Protocol

For every modification, 115 to 200 peptides were selected from in-house data or public databases. Modified peptides and their unmodified counterpart peptides were generated using Fmoc-based SPOT synthesis protocols. Peptides were subjected to multimodal LC-MS analysis using a Orbitrap Fusion ETD mass spectrometer. Modifications compise: Lysine acetylation, biotinylation, butyrylation, crotonylation, dimethylation, formylation, glutarylation, hydroxyisobutyrylation, malonylation, methylation, propionylation, succinylation, trimethylation and glyglycylation (ubiquitination). Arginine citrullination, dimethyalation (symmetric/asymmetric), methylation. Hydroxyproline. Tyrosine nitration, phosphorylation

### Data Processing Protocol

Identification of tandem MS data was performed using MaxQuant v 1.5.3.30 searching against a database of concatenated peptide sequences. Raw spectra were extracted from the instrument files using ThermoRAWFileReader. Characterization of chromatrographic (retention time) and mass spectrometric properties (charges, scores, fragmentation behaviour, diagnostic ions/immonium ions, neutral losses) were performed using custom python and R scripts.
