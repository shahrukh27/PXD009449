PXD009449 dataset was part of study punlished in 2018 titled: Systematic characterization of 21 post-translational modification using synthetic peptides. It was based on the synthesis of ~5000 synthetic peptides with 21 different post-translational modifications (PTMs).

I used PXD009449 dataset in my MS Thesis (https://github.com/shahrukh27/MS-Thesis.git). Following steps were followed in data pre-processing.

Following table details the MS/MS counts before and after data cleanup:
